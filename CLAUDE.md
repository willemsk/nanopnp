# Project: nanopnp

Open-source Python reimplementation of the **ePNP-NS** continuum framework for simulating
biological nanopores (Willems et al., *Nanoscale* **12**, 16775–16795, 2020), replacing a COMSOL
workflow. 2D-axisymmetric steady state; structure → mesh → solve → analyse as one pipeline.
Python 3.11–3.14, developed on 3.12.

## Before doing anything

- **Read `.knowledge/00-index.md`**: the verified knowledge base (physics, numerics, biology, tooling).
- **`SPECIFICATION.md` is normative** (`FR-`, `QR-`, `CON-`, `PHY-`, `NUM-`, `VER-`, `VAL-`). Cite the
  identifier when you implement or test one. Changing specified behaviour means changing the
  specification in the same commit.
- **Never web-search the model equations, correction functions or parameters.** Popular summaries are
  wrong. `.knowledge/01-physics-epnpns.md` is normative and documents five errata; where sources
  disagree, the COMSOL model report governs (§1.6). Web search is fine for library versions/APIs
  (prefer Context7) and post-knowledge-base literature.

## Setup

`uv` owns the environment: no `pip`, no manual `activate`, no bare `python`/`pytest`.

- `uv sync --all-extras` — create or refresh `.venv` from `uv.lock`
- `uv add <pkg>` / `uv add --group dev <pkg>` — add a dependency
- `uv run <anything>` — the only way code is executed
- After hand-editing `pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock`; CI runs with `UV_LOCKED` and fails on a stale lock.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `uv run pytest` | Tiers 1–2 without `extended` tests; the commit hook's selection |
| `uv run pytest --extended` | All of tiers 1–2; the push gate, as CI runs it. Naming an `extended` test's file runs it without the flag |
| `uv run pytest -n auto --dist loadfile` | Parallel; set `OMP_NUM_THREADS`, `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`, `MKL_NUM_THREADS` to 1. `tests/tier1/test_gui_widgets.py` runs separately and serially |
| `uv run pytest -m tier1` / `-m tier3` / `-m slow` | Unit tests / reference comparison (nightly, not gated) / benchmarks (not gated) |
| `uv run pytest <file>::<test> -v` | One test |
| `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format .` | Lint and format |
| `uv run mypy src/` | Type check (strict) |
| `uv run nanopnp --env` | Resolved environment and data locations |
| `uv sync --all-extras --group docs && uv run docs/scripts/generate.py && uv run mkdocs build --strict` | Documentation build, as CI's `docs` job (VER-45) |

Gate before committing: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy src/ && uv run pytest`.
Gate before pushing: `.claude/hooks/gate.sh run` (the above with `--extended`, plus coverage of changed lines).
`.claude/hooks/gate.sh` runs automatically before each `git commit` Claude Code makes; `--no-verify`
skips it. A pass of the hook's development selection never stands in for `run`.

- `run` requires, as CI does, full branch coverage of the lines changed in `src/nanopnp/` outside
  `gui/` (`diff-cover` against `main`). An exempt line says `# pragma: no cover - <reason>`.
- Coverage sees neither missing code nor the untaken arm of `a if c else b`; planned tests cover those.
- `run` sets `NANOPNP_REQUIRE_GMSH=1` (and `NANOPNP_REQUIRE_APBS=1` where the APBS wheel exists), so
  a backend that cannot import fails rather than skips.
- When only prose changed, the hook runs ruff alone. `.github/scripts/prose-only.sh` decides what is
  prose; `SPECIFICATION.md`, `docs/` and example READMEs are not. CI's strict documentation build
  runs on every push, prose included.

## Project structure

`src/nanopnp/` has one subpackage per module of SPECIFICATION.md §5.1:

- `core/` — units, constants, validation, provenance, caching, logging
- `structure/` — PDB/mmCIF and trajectory IO, alignment, symmetry-axis detection
- `density/` — Gaussian smearing to grid, ensemble averaging, grid IO
- `symmetry/` — Cₙ averaging, azimuthal reduction to (r, z), variance diagnostics
- `geometry/` — contour extraction, polyline conditioning, CAD assembly, analyte bodies
- `mesh/` — mesher adapters (netgen, gmsh), size fields, boundary layers, quality gates
- `numerics/` — linear-solver adapters, damped Newton, state and increment gates, the axisymmetric measure
- `charge/` — PDB2PQR driver, partial charges, smearing, axisymmetric projection, dielectric
- `materials/` — electrolyte models and the pluggable correction registry
- `physics/` — weak forms: Poisson, Nernst–Planck, Navier–Stokes; the wall-distance field
- `solve/` — continuation ladder, warm start, the solve stage
- `post/` — QoI extraction: current, transport number, EOF, rectification, forces
- `sweep/` — parameter sweeps, job-array dispatch, result collection
- `io/` — case-file schema, artefact and resolved-case types, result store, provenance manifests;
  the base layer, importing only `core` at run time
- `pipeline/` — case resolution against the registries, the walk, reproduction; the assembler
- `cli/`, `gui/` — thin shells over the stage objects; they hold no physics
- `validation/` — benchmarks, MMS, COMSOL comparison harness, regression fixtures

Outside it: `data/corrections/*.yaml` (fitted parameters, shipped in the
wheel), `.knowledge/`, `tests/tier{1,2,3,4}/`, `docs/`, `docs/plans/` (delivery plan for the current
phase; planning, not requirements — `SPECIFICATION.md` wins).

A stage takes typed inputs and emits a typed, serialisable artefact carrying a content hash. Every
stage must stay independently invocable, cancellable and introspectable (FR-27).

## Physics ground rules

- **Corrections are data, not code.** Parameters live in `data/corrections/*.yaml`; a new electrolyte
  never touches solver code.
- **Classical PNP-NS is a configuration, not a branch.** Each correction is independently switchable;
  disabling one selects the `none` model, not a code branch.
- **Deviations from the validated model go behind a flag, default off**, and must be verified against
  COMSOL before becoming default (e.g. dielectric-gradient body force, mollified distance field, an
  added mobility correction).
- **`⟨c⟩` is `(1/n)Σcᵢ`, not the ionic strength**; they coincide only for a symmetric 1:1 salt. `d` is the distance to the nearest **pore**
  boundary; the membrane is excluded.
- **Einstein holds only at infinite dilution.** `D_i/μ_i` drifts to 1.2–1.7 × kT/e between 0.15 M
  and 3 M. Never assert `D_i/μ_i = kT/e` at finite concentration
  (VER-05, PHY-14). Poisson–Boltzmann is not "PNP at zero bias" (PHY-24).
- **Ion wall function: `1 − exp(−6.2(d̄ + 0.01))`** — plus, 6.2 nm⁻¹. The viscosity wall function takes
  a minus. Steric `β_i` enters the flux bracket with `+`, and the bracket is negated; a flipped sign
  diverges.

## Numerics rules

- **Assert, don't hope.** Charge conservation, packing fraction < 1, concentration positivity at every
  Newton iterate, mesh quality (min SICN/gamma > 0.3). A gate failure aborts with a diagnostic naming
  the gate, quantity and location (QR-12). Never return a plausible wrong answer.
- **Integration order ≥ 3 on every form carrying `1/r`** (VER-07); order 2 samples `r = 0` and gives NaN.
- **Never compute ionic current from a cross-section integral of the CG flux.** Use the indicator form
  or the variational reaction flux, and cross-check both (FR-23, QR-04; `.knowledge/06` §7).
- **Newton convergence needs the relative update on the undamped direction as well as the residual**;
  residual alone breaks warm starts. Never call a step that raised the residual convergence.
- **Reach hard cases by continuation, not a cold solve** (FR-17); warm-start sweeps from a converged
  neighbour.
- **Record the stabilisation mode with every number.** COMSOL ran streamline and crosswind
  stabilisation on; results are not comparable until matched (§6.4, §7.4).

## Coding conventions

- `from __future__ import annotations` in every module; type hints on every signature; `mypy --strict` clean.
- NumPy-style docstrings on public functions.
- SI internally; units in the name at the boundary (`radius_nm`, `bias_V`). No bare floats in interfaces.
- British spelling in prose and identifiers (`normalise`, `analyse`).
- `pathlib.Path`, never `os.path`. f-strings, never `%`/`.format()` (exceptions: one `%` over a whole
  numeric array as in `validation/apbs.py`'s `write_dx`; lazy `logging` arguments).
- Pydantic models at every serialisation boundary; never raw dicts across a stage boundary.
- `logging`, never `print()`, outside the CLI's own output. No `import *`.
- Cite the source (`.knowledge/` file or specification section) of every physical constant and fit
  coefficient in a comment.
- **Imports at the top of the module.** Exceptions, imported inside the function that uses them:
  `ngsolve`, `netgen`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `meshio`, `h5py` (import cost; stage modules are imported
  just to introspect), and an optional extra's package in a module that must work without it (a
  missing extra is refused naming it). A module reached only through `create()`, such as
  `structure/read.py`, imports its extra at the top. Defer nothing else; VER-72 (a) checks it.

## Testing

Tests live in `tests/tier{1,2,3,4}/` (tiers per SPECIFICATION.md §7.1); the directory's `conftest.py`
sets the marker, so the file's location decides its tier.

| Tier | Content | Runtime | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Unit and property tests (VER-01 … VER-11) | seconds | every push |
| 2 | Analytic benchmarks (VER-12 … VER-22) | minutes | every push |
| 3 | Cross-implementation comparison: the published results (VAL-16, VAL-17), VAL-05, VAL-06, COMSOL fields where exported (VAL-01 … VAL-04) | hours | nightly, recorded not gated |
| 4 | Experimental reproduction (VAL-07 … VAL-14) | hours | before a tagged release |

- Name tests for the requirement they discharge: `test_ver03_ion_wall_function_check_values`.
- Fix Tier 2 before chasing a Tier 3 discrepancy; an analytic test localises an error, a whole-model
  comparison does not.
- No network and no COMSOL licence in tests; Tier 3 reads archived reference data.

## Provenance and reproducibility

The case file (`schema: nanopnp/case/v0.5`) is the unit of reproducibility. Every artefact carries a
content hash over its payload and producing parameters, which is its cache key. Every result carries a
manifest (input hashes, library versions, mesh hash, solver settings, stabilisation mode, correction
file versions, **every switch set away from the validated default**; FR-25, §5.3.3). A result whose
manifest cannot reconstruct the run is not a result.

## Implementation workflow

One work package per PR, green on tiers 1–2 before the next. To plan or resume, start at
`docs/plans/current.md`, then the WP's Execution brief and its cited sections. Keep the brief bounded;
a brief never overrides a normative requirement.

| Step | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `/phase-plan <n\|amend>` | Puts the phase's decisions to the author; writes rulings into §8.2 and the plan into `docs/plans/` |
| 1 | `/wp-plan <n>` | Writes and commits the WP implementation plan |
| 2 | `/wp-implement` | Executes the plan, keeps specification/knowledge/plan in step, gates, pushes, opens or reuses the PR, stops |
| 3–4 | `/wp-ship` | Gates, pushes, runs `/code-review xhigh --fix`, drives CI to green |

Step 2 does not chain into 3: the user starts `/wp-ship` in a fresh session, so the review comes from
a session that did not make the physics decisions (`wp-ship` §4). `.claude/skills/steward/SKILL.md`
governs a PR in flight and is read when a PR event wakes a session.

**Sub-agent models:** work whose error would be a plausible wrong number runs on Opus; work whose error
is loud (lint, types, search, mechanical edits) runs on Sonnet. State the choice when delegating
(`.claude/model-policy.md`).

**Plans mark each work item `[Opus]` or `[any]`.** A non-Opus session may do an `[Opus]` item only at
extra effort and on the record: its planned tests run and fail first (if it has none, the session
writes them first in their own commit), the commit body states the decision with its signs, units
and route, the tick reads `non-Opus`, and the PR lists it under **Done outside Opus** for the Opus
review in `/wp-ship` (`.claude/model-policy.md`, *Who implements a plan*).

**Code review reports** from `/codebase-review` go to `docs/code_reviews/CODE_REVIEW_NNN.md`, numbered
one above the highest present, never reused; pass `out=` so no root `CODE_REVIEW.md` remains.

**Open items** (a confirmed finding not fixed, a deferral, a question for the author) are `REV-nn` rows
in `docs/project/review-findings.md` with a section in `docs/project/review-items.md`, until the commit
that resolves one sets it `fixed` (§8.2.8 H12). A PR body may summarise them, never be their only record.

## Git

- Conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `chore:`); name the requirement identifier
  discharged in the body (`VER-03`, `FR-16`).
- Versions are git tags, never a number in `pyproject.toml` or the package (§2.7). A WP's PR writes its
  `CHANGELOG.md` section under `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`; after merge, tag its last commit on `main`
  (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, *Versions and releases*).

## Durable learnings

Write a durable fact into the relevant `.knowledge/` file, with its source, marked **[tested]**
(verified by running code) or **[verified]** (verified by arithmetic). Keep status, task lists and scope opinions out of `.knowledge/`; they belong in the specification.

## Do NOT

- Use `pip`, a hand-activated venv, or bare `python`/`pytest`.
- Import `gmsh` on the default path (GPLv2+, optional backend only; CON-10, ADR-002). Depend on
  Triangle, MeshPy or TetGen (CON-12). Use PyQt (PySide6 only; CON-09).
- Add anything to the end-user path needing a C++ compiler, source build or JIT (CON-07).
- Write the weak forms twice, or put backend-specific constructs in `physics/` (QR-13).
- Hard-code correction coefficients, `ε_protein` or any fitted parameter in Python.
- Add COMSOL import/export (N7), transient solves (N3), 3D (N4) or off-axis analytes (N5); the
  architecture must not preclude them.
